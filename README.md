NSFWDetector is a small (**17 kB**) CoreML Model to scan images for nudity. It was trained using CreateML to distinguish between porn/nudity and appropriate pictures. With the main focus on distinguishing between instagram model like pictures and porn.

## Usage

```swift
guard let detector = NSFWDetector.shared else {
    return
}

detector.check(cgImage: image, completion: { result in
    switch result {
    case let .success(nsfwConfidence: confidence):
        if confidence > 0.9 {
            // üò±üôàüòè
        } else {
            // ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
        }
    default:
        break
    }
})
```

If you want to enforce stricter boundaries for your platform, just apply a lower threshold for the confidence.

## Installation

NSFWDetector is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'NSFWDetector'
```

## App Size

The Machine Learning Model is only **17 kB** in size, so App size won't be affected compared to other libraries using the [yahoo model](https://github.com/yahoo/open_nsfw).

## Using just the Model

If you don't want to use the Detection Code, you can also just download the MLModel file directly from the latest [Release](https://github.com/lovoo/NSFWDetector/releases).

## Training Data

V2 uses data out of [NudeNet_v1](https://archive.org/details/NudeNet_classifier_dataset_v1)
